Cloth Classifier with PyTorch


Overview


This repository contains the implementation of a cloth classifier model using the Fashion MNIST dataset and PyTorch. The model is designed to classify different types of clothing items such as shirts, dresses, shoes, etc.



Dataset


The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories. It serves as a drop-in replacement for the traditional MNIST dataset and is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning models in the field of computer vision.


Model Architecture


The cloth classifier model is built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library. The architecture comprises layers of convolutional, ReLU activation, max-pooling, and a fully connected layer.


Training the Model


The model is trained using the training dataset with the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.


Evaluating the Model


The model is evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
