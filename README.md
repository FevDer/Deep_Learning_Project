Cloth Classifier with PyTorch

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a cloth classifier model using the Fashion MNIST dataset and PyTorch. The model is designed to classify different types of clothing items such as shirts, dresses, shoes, etc.

Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories. It serves as a drop-in replacement for the traditional MNIST dataset and is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning models in the field of computer vision.

Model Architecture

The cloth classifier model is built using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library. The architecture comprises layers of convolutional and fully connected neural network layers, leveraging PyTorch's flexibility and ease of use for constructing deep learning models.

Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
NumPy
Matplotlib# Deep_Learning_Project

Results

The model achieves an accuracy of  0.8884000182151794 on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying clothing items.
